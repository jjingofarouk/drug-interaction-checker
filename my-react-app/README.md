## How It Works

1. **Search for Medications**:
   - Enter the name of the first and second medication in the search fields.
   - The app provides autocomplete suggestions based on the drug database.

2. **View Interactions**:
   - If a direct interaction exists between the two medications, it will be displayed with a detailed description.

3. **Related Suggestions**:
   - If no direct interaction is found, the app suggests related interactions involving the searched medications.
